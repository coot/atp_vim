No file juicer.bbl 
No file juicer.ind
(./juicer.aux)

(after first compilation! -> can be used to know that we have to run bibtex)

Package biblatex Warning: Please (re)run Biber on the file:
(biblatex)                juicer
(biblatex)                and rerun LaTeX afterwards.

Package biblatex Warning: Please (re)run BibTeX on the file(s):

Named Destinations:
\hypertarget{dest_name}{text}

    xpdf -remote sname -exec gotoDest\("dest_name"\)

    xpdf -remote sname -exec run\("echo %f > /dev/pts/19"\)

will print file name loaded in the server sname. This is how this command
should be escaped. It will be needed for reverse search (xpdf -> vim).

gvim --servername GVIM --remote-expr  "atplib#FindAndOpen('%f','%l')"'

s:CompleteLabels (LatexBox_complete.vim)
s:LatexmkCallBack (LatexBox_latexmk.vim)

plain tex notes:
	no \cite	command
	no \ref		command
	no \textsf	command
	no \sf		command

pgfrcs.tex	
	def files not working with gf in plaintex.
		/ after using atplib#append_ext /

	no \(:\) and \[:\] pairs

there is only one math syntax region: 
	    paintexMath	

To Do: add support for plain TeX users in the function atplib#search#SearchPackage()
	in TeX one writes: '\input tikz.tex' instead of '\usepackage{tikz}'
	in while in ConTeXt '\usemodule[tikz]'

Syntax motion:	
two modes ctrl-j and ctrl-J (both forward) J goes further than j (there can be also ctrl-k anc ctrl-K going backward).
    texStatement
    texMathZone...	- rather not
    texTitle
    texMatcher
    texMathMatcher
    texSectionName	\section{texSectionName}[texSectionModifier]
    texSectionModifier

    texSuperscript	every ^{}
    texSubscript	every _{}	they should be counted together and the function should place the cursor where the last one ends

    texSuperscripts any ^{}
    texSubscripts	any _{}

To Do: ADD SUPPORT FOR subfiles.sty AND subfiles.cls :)
To Do: atplib#motion#JMotion

REPORT: Dsearch is 3 times faster from 1.2 second to 0.4 second
	TreeOfFiles is 1/4 faster from ~0.4s to ~0.3 s
	USING PYTHON :))
